- [firebase](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) as a cloud database

## Redux Thunk and Firebase Firestore

Once the components are defined, they are tied to the management of information through the application. For this, Redux is implemented with the store-reducer-action structure as usual, however, not only the data is handled through the actions but the success and error responses are also defined by the same form.

**Redux Thunk**

Thunk middleware for Redux. It allows writing functions with logic inside that can interact with a Redux store's dispatch and getState methods.
 


**Firebase**

The **Cloud Firestore** data model supports flexible, hierarchical data structures. Store your data in documents, organized into collections. Documents can contain complex nested objects in addition to subcollections.
